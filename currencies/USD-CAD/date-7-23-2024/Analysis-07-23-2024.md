    #### conclusion

    - so Before moving to the `daily` timeframe we `conclude` that:
        1) The last candle on the monthly timeframe is a `doji` which means `indecision` betweeen `buyers` and `sellers`. `No one is in control of the market`
        2) When we go to the `weekly` timeframe then we observe that during the `weeks of july` a `morning star` pattern has formed and `the market was ranging` . Given that this pattern forms at the middle of the `ranging` then it indicates a shift in momentum towards the bullish.

- We can observe that a `bullish` momentum was gained.
